# Home Assistant Add-on: Samba NAS share

## ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/f03c15.png) Important Note ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/f03c15.png)

This addon has been designed, built and tested to work with HAOS (Homeassistant Operating System). The use in other types of installations is not recommended and useless as other solutions given by the host can be used.

### Using it on a different operating system leads to the error at startup. I apologize to all the advanced users who are using it on different OSes but I manage the addon in my spare time and instead of doing something useful lately I'm only replying to people who don't read the documentation. "This is the meaning of life"

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Find the "Samba NAS share" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. In the configuration section, set a username and password.
2. Save the configuration.
3. Start the add-on.
4. Check the add-on log output to see the result.

## Connection

If you are on Windows you use `\\<IP_ADDRESS>\`, if you are on MacOS you use `smb://<IP_ADDRESS>` to connect to the shares.

This addon exposes the following directories over smb (samba):

| Directory | Description                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `addons`  | This is for your local add-ons.                                          |
| `backup`  | This is for your snapshots.                                              |
| `config`  | This is for your Home Assistant configuration.                           |
| `addon_configs`  | This is for your Addons base configuration directory                           |
| `media`   | This is for local media files.                                           |
| `share`   | This is for your data that is shared between add-ons and Home Assistant. |
| `ssl`     | This is for your SSL certificates.                                       |

### Option `available_disks_log` (optional)

### Option: `log_level` (optional)

- trace: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- debug: Shows detailed debug information.
- info: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- warning: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- error: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- fatal: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a more severe level, e.g., debug also shows info messages. By default, the log_level is set to info, which is the recommended setting unless you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `medialibrary` (optional) **_Exteprimental_**

Enable the visibility of `moredisk` on /media path.

_Starting from Homeassistant 2023.6.0 the addon use the 'mount' supervisor feature. So you don't need the ssh key anymore._

**WARNING: The feature is considered experimental and may cause problems or data loss.**
#### Option: `enable` (optional)

Enable/Disable host mounting option.

Defaults to `false`.

### Option: `recyle_bin_enabled` (optional)

Setting this option to `true` will enable recycle bin functions
on the Samba add-on. ***Check 'veto_files' as could be blocked by '._*'.***

Defaults to `false`.

#### Option: `ssh_private_key` (optional) **_Deprecated_**

The **_PRIVATE_** key for SSH access to the host on port 22222.

Enables mounting of `moredisk` by the host and not by the container. 

NOTE<sup>1</sup>: It works only and only on HassOS on other hosts it is not tested and most likely it does not work.

NOTE<sup>2</sup>: It is necessary to enable the access to the SSH port 22222 of the host. Read the HassOS [Developers Documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/operating-system/debugging/#home-assistant-operating-system) or use the [Configutarion Addon](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/add-on-hassos-ssh-port-22222-configurator/264109).

NOTE<sup>3</sup>: It is necessary to pass the SSH private key for root access to the host. Be sure to use secrets files to protect the key from people who don't have access to it.

NOTE<sup>4</sup>: If the disk in the "Media Browser" is seen empty try restarting Homeassitant.





### Option: `veto_files` (optional)

List of files that are neither visible nor accessible. Useful to stop clients
from littering the share with temporary hidden files
(e.g., macOS `.DS_Store` or Windows `Thumbs.db` files)

The list of additional user for the addon. See `acl` option for enable the access to the shares.

#### Option: `username` (required)

#### Option: `password` (required)

The password that goes with the username configured for authentication.

### Option: `acl` (optional) (**advanced users only**)

The Access Control List for shares. This is an advanced parameter to control every single share.
The format is an array of share object with this subparameters

#### Option: `share` (required)

The share name.

#### Option: `disabled` (optional)

If the disabled flag is true the share is not exported

If is true the share is exposed with timechine compatible setting.

Defaults to `false` for internal share, `true` forn extra disks.
 
### Option: `usage` (optional) (**valid only for external disks**)

Set the scope of the disk, usefull for ha network storage mount. Valid values are `media`,`backup`,`share` 

Defaults to `media` for external disks if `medialibray` is enabled.


### Option: `interfaces` (optional) (**advanced users only**)

The network interfaces Samba should listen on for incoming connections.

This option should only be used in advanced cases. In general, setting this option is not needed.

If omitted Samba will listen on all supported interfaces of Home Assistant (see > ha network info), but if there are no supported interfaces, Samba will exit with an error.

Note: Samba needs at least one non-loopback, non-ipv6, local interface to listen on and become browser on it. Without it, it works, but reloads it's interfaces in an infinite loop forever in each 10 seconds to check, whether a non-loopback, non-ipv6, local interface is added. This reload will fill the log file with infinite number of entries like added interface lo ip=::1 bcast= netmask=ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff.

### Option: `compatibility_mode` (optional)

Setting this option to `true` will enable old legacy Samba protocols
on the Samba add-on. This might solve issues with some clients that cannot
handle the newer protocols, however, it lowers security. Only use this
when you absolutely need it and understand the possible consequences.

Defaults to `false`.

Setting this option to `true` will enable the use of wsdd2 over wsdd. Set to true if you have trouble to see the disk on Windows 11+

Defaults to `false`.

### Option: `hdd_idle_seconds` (optional) (**Use only if your disks never spind down**)

### Common problems

- **_The disk does not mount_** : check that the Label of the partition of the disk you want to mount is case-sensitive with the label indicated in the `moredisk` parameter.

- **_In the menu `Media Browser` the folder with the name of the disk is empty_** : it happens when the homeassistant server starts before the add-on. Restart HomeAssitant from menu `Configuration->Server Controls->Server management -> RESTART`
