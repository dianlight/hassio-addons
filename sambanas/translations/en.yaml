  multi_channel:
    name: Enable Samba Multichannel support
    description:
      Multi-Channel is an SMB3 protocol feature that allows the client
      to bind multiple transport connections into one authenticated
      SMB session. This allows for increased fault tolerance and
      throughput. The client chooses transport connections as reported
      by the server and also chooses over which of the bound transport
      connections to send traffic. I/O operations for a given file
      handle can span multiple network connections this way.
      An SMB multi-channel session will be valid as long as at least
      one of its channels are up.
