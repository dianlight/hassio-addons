# Dockerfile Optimizations Applied

## Security Improvements

### 1. Binary Stripping
- **wsdd2**: Added `strip` command to remove debug symbols, reducing binary size and potential information leakage
- **QUIC libraries**: Strip shared libraries to reduce attack surface
- **Samba binaries**: Strip all executables to minimize size and remove debug information

### 2. Removed Unnecessary Packages
- Removed unused build dependencies from wsdd2 builder: `python3-dev`, `musl-dev`, `poetry`, `go`, `lsblk`, `eudev`
- Removed `git` from Samba builder (replaced with `wget` for deterministic downloads)
- Removed `kmod` from QUIC builder (not needed for userspace library)

### 3. Secure Download Practices
- Changed `curl -Lso` to `curl -fsSL -o` for better error handling and security
- Downloads fail fast if there are issues instead of silently continuing

### 4. Reduced Environment Variables
- Removed unused `CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI` (no Rust compilation)
- Removed unused `YARN_HTTP_TIMEOUT` (no Node.js/Yarn usage)
- Consolidated ENV statements for cleaner configuration

## Compilation Speed Improvements

### 1. Build Caching Optimization
- Restructured wsdd2 build to use `/tmp` directory, improving layer caching
- Separated package installation from compilation steps where possible
- Removed verbose tar output (`zxvf` â†’ `xzf`) for faster extraction

### 2. Parallel Compilation
- Ensured all `make` commands use `-j"$(nproc)"` for parallel builds
- Applied to: wsdd2, QUIC, and Samba compilation

### 3. Git Clone Optimization
- Added `--single-branch` flag to QUIC git clone for faster checkout
- Already using `--depth 1` for shallow clones

### 4. Layer Consolidation
- Combined related operations into single RUN statements
- Merged APFS installation with symlink creation
- Consolidated Samba runtime dependencies into the main installation block
- Combined s6-overlay permission setting into more efficient command

### 5. Cleanup in Same Layer
- All temporary files removed in the same RUN command that creates them
- wsdd2 build artifacts cleaned immediately after installation
- Prevents bloat in intermediate layers

## Additional Optimizations

### 1. Code Deduplication
- Moved binary copying to early stage for better layer reuse
- Consolidated Samba symlink creation with runtime dependency installation
- Combined all initialization steps for Samba configuration

### 2. Conditional Logic Improvements
- Better structured conditional blocks for distribution vs compiled Samba
- More efficient PATH and symlink setup

### 3. Command Efficiency
- Replaced `find ... -print0 | xargs -0` with `find ... -exec` for simpler execution
- Used `chmod a+x` consistently instead of octal notation
- Removed commented-out code for cleaner Dockerfile

### 4. Network Efficiency
- Use quiet/silent flags on wget/curl to reduce output
- Faster downloads with better error handling

## Size Reduction Summary

Estimated size reductions:
- **wsdd2**: ~30-40% size reduction from stripping
- **QUIC libraries**: ~25-35% size reduction from stripping
- **Samba binaries**: ~20-30% size reduction from stripping
- **Build dependencies**: Removed ~50MB of unnecessary packages
- **Layer efficiency**: Reduced intermediate layer bloat by ~10-15%

## Security Hardening Summary

1. **Attack Surface Reduction**: Stripped binaries contain less information for attackers
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Removed unnecessary build tools that won't be used at runtime
3. **Fail-Safe Downloads**: Better error handling prevents incomplete or corrupted downloads
4. **Clean Temporary Files**: No leftover build artifacts in final image

## Build Time Improvements

Expected build time improvements:
- **wsdd2**: 15-20% faster (parallel build + cleanup optimization)
- **QUIC**: 10-15% faster (single-branch clone + stripping)
- **Samba**: 5-10% faster (wget instead of git, better caching)
- **Overall**: 10-20% faster total build time depending on cache hit rate
