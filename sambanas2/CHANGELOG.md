## 2025.6.0-dev [ 🚧 Unreleased ]

### 🎉 NEWS NEWS 🎉
Great news for Home Assistant users! Get ready to revolutionize your storage management with SambaNAS2, the groundbreaking fork of the popular SambaNAS addon.

SambaNAS2 introduces a completely redesigned user experience, featuring a sleek, intuitive new interface that makes managing your disks and shares a breeze. But the real game-changer lies under the hood: a powerful new configuration engine called SRAT.

SRAT is engineered from the ground up to provide unparalleled control and flexibility. This innovative engine will dramatically simplify how you set up, configure, and maintain your storage within Home Assistant, transforming a once complex task into a seamless process.
